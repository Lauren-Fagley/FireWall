# Firewall is our first look into game development. We used Unity as our game enigne, Fl Stuidos for music, and Pixilart.com for our sprite design. We mostly used YouTube tutroials and online assests to handle the basics of Unity. Our is game is a 2d platformer that is robot themed and the goal is to get to the end without touching spikes or enemies. 
# Specifically, we used the Pixel Adventure 1 asset from the Unity Asset Store for the terrain, background, trophy, and spikes.
# We had some unused sprites we designed, like a final boss, projectiles, particles, and different color gems.
